# Fabric Detection Model - AWS Elastic Beanstalk Deployment

This branch contains all the necessary code and configuration files to deploy the Fabric Detection Model on AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EBS). This deployment branch focuses on setting up the infrastructure for serving the model as a web application, 
using AWS Elastic Beanstalk for hosting, AWS CodePipeline for Continuous Delivery and Amazon S3 for model storage.

This branch is finally merged into `development_branch`.
