This project is an end-to-end implementation of a **Fabric Detection Model** designed to classify corduroy and denim fabrics using machine learning techniques. The project consists of multiple stages, from data ingestion to final prediction, with both training and deployment pipelines.

------------------------- 
----------

##  üìå Key Features of This Project

- **Diverse Feature Extraction Methods**: Use of multiple feature extraction techniques to capture the distinct patterns of corduroy and denim fabrics.
- **Handling Image Variations**: We incorporate image augmentation techniques to make the model resilient to real-world variations
- **In-Memory Processing** - The model processes the images completely in-memory during prediction, avoiding the storage of unnecessary artifacts providing faster predictions and reducing memory overhead.
- **Nested Cross-Validation** - Evaluate model performance rigorously across multiple validation sets, ensuring high reliability in detecting corduroy and denim fabrics.
- **Efficient Error Handling & Logging** - A robust logging and error handling system to debug & resolve errors quickly.
- **Modular Code Structure**: Well-organized codebase with clear separation of concerns ensures updates are be applied to specific parts of the system without affecting the entire codebase, increasing maintainability.
- **Web Application**: User-friendly interface for real-time fabric detection, with image upload functionality.
- **Scalability with Cloud Integration**: The model is integrated with AWS Elastic Beanstalk for deployment and Amazon S3 for storage.


## üìå Pipelines in the Project

The **Fabric Detection Model** leverages image processing and machine learning algorithms to identify fabrics from images. The project is divided into two major pipelines:

1. **Training Pipeline** - For training the machine learning model on labeled fabric images.

     i. **Nested Cross Validation Pipeline**: Performs nested cross validation with RandomizedSearchCV to select the best model hyperparameters an evaluate the model performance through nested cross validation.

   ii. **Final Training Pipeline**: Trains the best selected model through nested cross validation pipeline on the entire training data.
   
3. **Deployment Pipeline** - For deploying the trained model and using it for predictions on new data. The deployment pipelne has been configured to be used on AWS Cloud.


## ìáó Branches in the Repository

1. `main` branch: Contains the production ready code to be deployed in AWS ElasticBeanstalk environment.
2. `laptop_notebooks_branch` : All the prototyping Jupyter notebooks made and tested on our local machine.
3. `colab_notebooks_branch`: All the prototyping Google Colab notebooks made & tested on Google Colaboratory Pro due to compute resource limitation on our local machine.
4. `development_branch`: Contains all the integrated changes after experimentation. Finally merged into `main` branch.
5. ` final_train_pipeline`: Feature branch of development_branch. Contains the finalized code for the Training Pipeline. This branch is merged into `development_branch`.
6. `deployment_pipeline`: Feature branch of development_branch. Contains the finalized code for Deployment Pipeline but not configured for AWS cloud. This branch is not merged into `development_branch`.
7. `ebs_deployment`: Feature branch of `deployment_pipeline` to integrate AWS configurations for deployment.
   This branch is merged into `development_branch` .
